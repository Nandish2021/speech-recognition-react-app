The speech to text system works with a speech recognition system; which recognizes your voice and convert it into text. It's much faster than conventional keyboard typing. <br>
<strong> Text-to-speech <strong> has additonal features viz., word count, character count, minutes read and preview section. <br>
It also has a voice assistant which is working with few commands for now, will make it better in upcoming days.
